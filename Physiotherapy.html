                                                The Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation at KGN Hospital is one of the largest tertiary level rehabilitation centres in North India, with presence at Varanasi, up Panch Each of the institutes is designed to offer the highest levels of patient care in the field of physiotherapy and rehabilitation. The department is an important aspect of KGN, helping patients gain back their independence after a disabling disease or a traumatic injury. Specialists in this area work with patients to help minimise the physical and cognitive effects of disability so that patients may reach their fullest potential.
                                               
                                                <br />
                                                Depending upon an individual's medical and emotional condition and personal goals, patients may experience a number of benefits as a result of physical therapy and rehabilitative care, including:

                                                <br />
                                                The ability to return to work
                                                <br />
                                                The ability to develop the skills necessary for independent living. Without such care, many of these patients would otherwise require long-term home care.

                                                <br />

                                                The Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation is a one-stop destination for all types of physiotherapy and rehabilitative treatments. A physiotherapist or an occupational therapist completes a thorough assessment that may include the patient's health history, evaluation of pain and movement patterns, range of motion, strength, reflexes, sensation and cardio-respiratory status. They also examine relevant x-rays, laboratory tests, medical records and surgical notes. Based on this assessment, the therapist develops a diagnosis and works in partnership with the patient to plan individualised goals and treatment programs. This the department offers via the following services:

                                                <br />
                                                Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation
                                                <br />
                                                The department has a Cardiac Rehabilitation Program that helps patients with various cardiac conditions to achieve optimal physical function. It includes an evaluation of the patient, exercise, education, counselling, risk factor modification and learning ways to live a healthier life. The program is a safe and effective way to help patients recover faster, get stronger, reduce stress, decrease the risks of future heart problems, and live longer.

                                                Geriatric care (Prevention of falls)
                                                <br />
                                                More than one-third of the elderly population (ages 65 and older) fall each year. Nowadays, many senior citizens imprison themselves in their homes due to fear of falling. They lose the physical benefits of normal activity and compromise balance and muscle strength, putting themselves at an even greater risk. Impaired vision or mental functioning as a result of medication are other risk factors.

                                                <br />
                                                The department's geriatric care programme offers senior patients with a number of benefits. The physiotherapists devise a personalised treatment programme to help patients regain their independence, maximise safety, reducing the risk of falling, restoring their confidence, helping them carry out daily activities, improving mobility indoors and outdoors, maintaining their muscle strength, providing balance and walking re-education and improving quality of life, overall.

                                                Dysphagia management
                                                <br />
                                                The Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation has expertise and experience in treating dysphagia (swallowing problems) caused by various diseases, especially dysphagia followed by a stroke. The treatment chosen depends on the patient's condition and nature of the problem. Difficulty in swallowing caused by motility disorders is treated by stretching narrowed passages. While dysphagia caused by neurological problems such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, stroke or spinal cord injury requires treating the underlying condition. In many cases, the doctors here use VitalStim Therapy (an electrical stimulation therapy) for the treatment of dysphagia. It helps in correcting dysphagia at early stages of the condition, prevents its progression to the point where the patient may require a feeding tube and enables many patients on tubes to return to normal or partly-normal eating.

                                                Rehabilitation for neurological disorders
                                                <br />
                                                The department's staff focuses on the restoration of function in people with a wide range of disabling injuries and illnesses. Therapists deal not only with the physical aspects of injury or disease but also the person's social, emotional and vocational wellbeing. Their practice of physiotherapy and rehabilitation is based on a holistic and comprehensive approach to medical care for individuals who have experienced an impairment resulting from an injury, disease process or developmental disorders.

                                                <br />
                                                Neurological Rehabilitation programs are conducted on both, inpatient and outpatient cases. A dedicated neurological rehabilitation team revolves around patients and their families, helping them set short and long-term treatment goals for recovery.

                                                Managing sports injuries
                                                <br />
                                                Most sports injuries (muscle strains, ligament sprains, bruises, etc.) are caused by the overuse/misuse of a muscle or joint. However, there are preventive methods that can significantly reduce the risk of injury. The physiotherapists at the Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation help people of all ages and lifestyles gain their desired level of active living and physical functioning. With their applied knowledge and understanding of the human body in action, they are able to help sports enthusiasts increase mobility, relieve pain, build strength and improve balance and cardiovascular function. The physiotherapists not only treat injuries but also teach how to prevent the onset of pain or injury that can limit one's activity.

                                                KGN Multi-speciality has long held that the needs of the patient come first. This belief is evidenced in the patient-centred care offered by the Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation. It is committed to providing patient care through teamwork. Throughout the duration of treatment at Reliance Multi-speciality, patients receive the attention and care of a closely coordinated group of rehabilitation specialists, each of whom brings unique expertise to the team.



                                                <br />
                                                Disabling diseases and traumatic injuries affect each patient differently. Accordingly, the doctors here deliver comprehensive treatment through personal and individualised care that considers the unique needs, abilities and objectives of each patient. The goal is to help patients help themselves. The department recognises that physiotherapy and rehabilitation patients are not passive recipients, but active participants in their own recovery. Accordingly, patients' families and the department's staff work together to set and follow individualised treatment plans for recovery. When implementing these treatment plans, patients benefit greatly from Reliance low patient-to-therapist ratio. In most instances, patients work one-on-one with their therapists. They also benefit from Max's extensive array of patient care resources, including state-of-the-art medical equipment.



                                                <br />
                                                KGN Multi-speciality heathcare also believes that patient education is an important part of delivering excellent medical care. The Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation staff weaves patient education opportunities into its daily rehabilitation activities. During these teaching moments, doctors use one-on-one discussions and teaching materials to educate patients about their medical condition and rehabilitative care.



                                                <br />
                                                In the end, caring, nurturing and helping people heal with a personalised touch and patient connection is what KGN Multi-speciality strives for. And this is what sets it apart
